CS320-SentenceSeparator

School coding assignment that uses python code to take in a text file and separates sentences that are joined together by the words: for, and, nor, but, or, yet. 
This code takes in a file, and throws an error if the file is not found.  Then, the code splits up the sentence in the file, then prints out the individual sentences
in numerical order. The one, long compound sentence is now numerous simple sentences.
